1. Go to folder frontend `cd frontend`
2. Install the packages using package manager `pnpm i`.
3. Run `pnpm dev`.
4. There are some typescript issues, unfortunately due to time barrier I wasn't able to resolve all of them. However, it should work perfectly in the local environment
5. Check out `http://localhost:3000/landing` to check landing page design.
6. Check out `http://localhost:3000/schema` to check out database diagramming tool.
